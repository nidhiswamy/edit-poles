# Edit Poles Widget

This custom widget is created in ArcGIS Web AppBuilder to help users select, display, and edit sample pole data.

## Description

The sample pole data was created through a geodatabase file in ArcGIS Pro and published to the ESRI portal as a web map. A web app is built using ArcGIS Web AppBuilder, 
which uses this web map as a reference to edit all data. This widget aims to let users draw a polygon over an area on the map and displays the data given, while allowing 
them to add, delete, and customize the poles. They can also choose to view the selection in a new graphics layer.

## Installation
1. Follow the [Getting Started Guide - Developer's Edition](https://developers.arcgis.com/web-appbuilder/guide/getstarted.htm)
2. For portal URL, specify the portal you published the web map in. 
3. Create your custom 2D web map and under widgets, hit Add Widget. 
4. The *Edit Poles* custom widget should appear in the list of all widgets.
5. Once added, configure the settings to match your required customizations!
